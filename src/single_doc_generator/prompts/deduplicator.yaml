  You are checking if a new question is a semantic duplicate of existing questions.

  Two questions are duplicates if they ask for THE SAME INFORMATION, even if worded
  differently. They test the same knowledge and would have the same answer.

  Examples of DUPLICATES:
  - "Who wrote Hamlet?" vs "Which playwright authored Hamlet?"
  - "What year did WWII end?" vs "When was World War II concluded?"
  - "What is the capital of France?" vs "Name France's capital city"

  Examples of NOT duplicates (related but different):
  - "Who wrote Hamlet?" vs "When was Hamlet written?" (different facts)
  - "What is the capital of France?" vs "What is France's largest city?" (different questions)
  - "How many pages is the document?" vs "How many chapters does it have?" (different counts)

  NEW QUESTION TO CHECK:
  {{ new_question }}

  EXISTING QUESTIONS:
  {% for q in existing_questions %}
  {{ loop.index }}. {{ q }}
  {% endfor %}

  Determine if the new question is semantically equivalent to ANY of the existing
  questions. If it duplicates one, provide that question EXACTLY as written above.
