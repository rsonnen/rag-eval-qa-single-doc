However, its application across different institutions continues to be challenging given the diversity of needs and resource availability among different institutions globally. Moreover, the use of a variety of different panels, including those from a few individual genes to those involving hundreds of genes, results in a relatively skewed distribution of care for patients. It is imperative to obtain a higher level of standardization without having to be restricted to specific kits or requiring repeated validations, which are generally expensive.

Addressing this challenge requires a robust clinical data set with a variety of tumor and sample types curated over several years in addition to cell-line–based controls to establish a valid truth set. Such a validation effort also requires a robust informatics pipeline that not only yields the data in a short turnaround time, but also offers a plethora of quality control (QC) metrics at both the FASTQ and binary alignment map level, such as number of reads properly paired, duplication rate, and DOC of reads among others. These metrics may aid in evaluation and identification of subtle patterns in data that guide key decisions on the wet bench, such as number of samples to run per lane of a flowcell of a sequencing platform to meet enough average DOC for an exome. This could further ensure considerable DOC of several exons (with enough padding of splice sites, ideally ±5 bp) and CDS are met,<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> consequently resulting in each position within those regions covered at a considerable read depth, which is crucial for calling variants reliably at variant allele fractions (VAFs) of ideally, at ≥5% tumor-only WES.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref></p><p id="p0020">WES facilitates detection of a wide variety of variant classes, including single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), copy number variants (CNVs), insertions, deletions, and surrogate biomarkers, such as mutational signatures, tumor mutation burden (TMB), and microsatellite instability, that aid treatment and management of patients in the clinic.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> WES has been used extensively in cancer research to identify novel variants in various cancer types and their subtypes.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> The adoption of WES in clinical genomic laboratories will likely eliminate the burden of frequent revalidation of NGS assays and reduce a huge time gap to make added gene sets live and reportable.

Along with SNVs, Indels, and CNVs, biomarkers, such as TMB, microsatellite instability, and mutational signatures, could be identified reliably using the WES backbone compared with gene panels. WES allows for rapid expansion of reportable gene lists as new targeted therapies become available, reducing the burden of end-to-end assay revalidation. Our validation shows that use of automation and reliable clinical software suites can greatly accelerate the implementation of WES and whole genomes in clinical practice.</p><p id="p0215">Our use of AUGMET, a fully bidirectionally interfaced informatics and clinical decision support suite, greatly reduced the burden of data analysis and reporting. The flexibility of deploying all infrastructure in a health care system–controlled virtual private cloud alleviates several concerns regarding data storage and privacy among physicians and patients alike compared with data being transferred to a third-party–controlled environment. Implementation of such architectures allows free movement of data across all hospital infrastructure, including clinical trial support software, data warehouses, and the electronic medical record, through Health Level Seven (HL7)–, Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)–, and application programming interface (API)–based integrations with overburdening intra-organizational information technology security staff.</p><p id="p0220">The validation of the DH-CancerSeq assay in its current form is limited with a VAF sensitivity threshold of 5%, which we will aim to improve in upcoming versions of the assay along with the addition of several biomarkers, such as TMB and microsatellite instability. Interestingly, the normalization matrix in preliminary studies for validation of TMB shows that germline variants can be normalized and equivalence in TMB classification with reference laboratory results and available controls can be achieved. However, this is an ongoing effort. We are working on building in cbioportal and American Association for Cancer Research data frequencies to provide additional support. In addition to this DNA-based fusion detection, an important tool to increase confidence in low-expressing fusion will be supported in future versions. The lowest input concentration validated for our assay was 14 ng of total DNA, and this may be challenging for some low-content cytology specimens and similar. This does require further optimizations to support lower input of nucleic acids.</p><p id="p0225">Although the initial validation was performed against the DNA component of the TST170 assay, at the time of manuscript submission, an additional 51 genes had been validated without any significant investment. New genes were reviewed for both exon and hotspot coverage before clinical implementation. The goal is to continue to add genes over the next several months to minimize the time from target identification to clinical application. As larger panels and genomic assays become the standard of care, WES and potentially whole-transcriptome–based assays are likely to become integral to cancer care.</p></sec><sec
