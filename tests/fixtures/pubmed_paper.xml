We present a sustained outbreak spanning over 18 months (1 January 2022–29 August 2023) in a NICU in Antwerp, Belgium, affecting 61 neonates, identified through samples taken for diagnostic purposes and by rectal screening. Ten neonates were infected: five with lower respiratory tract infection, four with conjunctivitis and one fatal case with sepsis.

Whole genome sequencing-based multilocus sequence typing (wgMLST) and core genome single nucleotide polymorphism (cgSNP) analysis of isolates from clinical (n = 4), screening (n = 52) and environmental samples (n = 8), identified eight clusters and five singletons not associated with the clusters. Although outbreak measures were successful in containing further spread within the ward during sudden surges when &gt; 4 cases per week were identified (peak events), several peaks with different clonal clusters occurred. The emergence of similar outbreaks in Belgian hospitals underscores the need of continuous surveillance and NICU-specific infection prevention and control (IPC) measures.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords: </title><kwd><italic toggle="yes">Serratia marcescens</italic></kwd><kwd>NICU</kwd><kwd>outbreak</kwd><kwd>whole genome sequencing</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-license-ref</meta-name><meta-value>CC BY</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>sequence</meta-name><meta-value>6</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text id="ba" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Key public health message</title></caption><p><bold>What did you want to address in this study and why?</bold></p><p><italic toggle="yes">Serratia marcescens</italic> is a bacterium found in a large variety of environments, from soil and water to insect guts or hospital wards.

The incidence of late-onset neonatal sepsis caused by <italic toggle="yes">S. marcescens</italic> has been estimated to 2.3 infections per 1,000 preterm infants. The infection is associated with significant morbidity and a reduced rate of survival (adjusted relative risk (RR): 0.88) [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Risk factors among neonates for acquisition of or infection with <italic toggle="yes">Serratia</italic> are low birth weight (&lt; 1,500 g), use of broad-spectrum antimicrobials, complex chronic conditions and indwelling catheter lines [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Outbreaks of <italic toggle="yes">S. marcescens</italic> are challenging to control and require early detection and rapid implementation of strict infection prevention and control (IPC) measures [<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Although environmental sources of infection can usually not be identified and cross-transmission via hands of healthcare workers is assumed to be the main mode of transmission, water sources (e.g. washbasins, air conditioning), liquid nutrition (e.g. breast milk, baby formula, total parenteral nutrition), soaps, disinfectants and medication have been implicated in <italic toggle="yes">Serratia</italic> outbreaks [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>In Belgium, surveillance of infectious diseases is performed by the Scientific Institute of Public Health, Sciensano, with support by the National Reference Centers.

At the start of the outbreak, we decided not to close the ward but to limit new admissions, initiate contact isolation measures by rearranging the location of the cases and labelling a case visible for staff but not for the parents or other visitors and start systematic rectal screening of neonates in the ward (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). The limitation on new admissions was implemented, as during the outbreak, the occupancy in the ward was high which could have had a limiting effect on the correct implementation of IPC measures. As a full closure would have a considerable impact on the activity of the maternity centre of our hospital and the surrounding hospitals, we decided to limit new admissions than force a full closure. During the first week of the outbreak declaration, daily on-site visits by the outbreak control team took place to investigate possible outbreak sources and transmission routes. Dedicated nursing staff was assigned and cohorting of the affected neonates was initiated. Cleaning and disinfection practices within the ward were reinforced by assigning specialised personnel. Following the initial meeting on 1 March 2022, in which outbreak control measures were set, weekly team meetings were held to re-evaluate the situation. The admission limitation was discontinued on 31 March 2022 once a case-free interval of 2 weeks was observed and after 13 cases had been discharged from the ward.</p><p>After the first sequencing batch was analysed on 1 September 2022, which revealed polyclonality of the outbreak and that origin from a single environmental source was unlikely, we decided to adapt our guidelines aiming to terminate all measures after a case-free interval of 2 weeks, including rectal screening. We decided to continue the systematic screening of drains. When a new case was detected on 13 February 2023, the previously applied outbreak control measures were re-introduced, except for restriction on admissions to the ward, which was not reinstated due to its significant impact on the activities of the maternity services of the hospital. Also, a new protocol for incubator disinfection was introduced as from this date, in which the incubator of a discharged neonate was disinfected with nebulised hydrogen peroxide before a new admission.</p><p>On 1 March 2023, four heated drains were installed (large washbasins: washbasin1, 2 and 3 and a small washbasin: washbasin5). These drains have a once daily thermo-disinfection protocol wherein the drain is heated to 85°C for 5–6 cycles. However, <italic toggle="yes">S. marcescens</italic> was repeatedly isolated from samples from an incorrectly installed heated drain. As a precautionary measure, all four heated drains were removed on 18 July 2023.</p><p>All outbreak measures, including rectal screening and sampling of drains were discontinued on 29 August 2023. It was decided that moving forward, all measures (disinfection by specialised personnel, contact isolation, nebulisation of the incubators, rectal screening, environmental screening) would be reinstated if <italic toggle="yes">S. marcescens</italic> was detected from clinical samples of two patients within a 2-week period.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>During this extended outbreak, various outbreak control measures were implemented to decrease and contain the high rate of cases. As many NICUs, including ours, are open wards, an effective contact isolation can be difficult. By rearranging the location of cases and using all available spaces, in combination with a label of a case, an effective contact isolation could be achieved. However, this implicitly requires an extensive case-finding strategy. We chose to use rectal swabs as these have been shown to be the most sensitive sample and detection site [<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Other sample types commonly employed are conjunctival swabs, samples from the respiratory tract (mainly nasal) and swabs of the umbilicus [<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. We preferred to have an extensive screening using only rectal swabs rather than samples from multiple sites from a single patient.</p><p>Given that <italic toggle="yes">S. marcescens</italic> was detected from only washbasin drains and not from other environmental samples during the initial environmental screening, we implemented a systematic screening of all drains on the ward. We observed that the number of positive drains reflected the number of cases in the ward. Our data and other recent studies argue for the removal of drains from NICU patient rooms and favour water-free care for neonates that could reduce NICU patient colonisation rates with Gram-negative bacteria like <italic toggle="yes">S. marcescens</italic> [<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>-<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Eventually, we opted to remove most washbasins, which until now, proved effective in avoiding a resurgence.</p><p>Intensive screening of patients and hospital environment can be costly and labour intensive for the hospital and the microbiology laboratory. A continuous monitoring outside of an outbreak setting could enable an early detection of a silent spread within a ward and possibly predict the outbreak potential of a genetically well-characterised pathogen. Such a continuous monitoring might be feasible using a targeted approach i.e., tracking strains from clinical samples and a periodic screening of the environment, of which washbasin drains appear to have the most reservoir potential, and thus creating a view on the NICU pathobiome.</p><p>In a previous NICU outbreak of <italic toggle="yes">Enterobacter</italic> spp., incubators were one of the major contributing factors in transmission [<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. We found several clusters and different incubators involved in the present outbreak. However, the setup of incubators in N1 and cots in N2 limited our ability to effectively define direct causation between being nursed in an incubator and <italic toggle="yes">S. marcescens</italic> colonisation. In N2, isolates from cases colonised with <italic toggle="yes">S. marcescens</italic> belonged to the same clusters as environmental isolates and case isolates from N1, but cases in N2 were fewer than in N1. Although we also found an association between <italic toggle="yes">S. marcescens</italic> and nursing inside an incubator, we do not consider this to be the primary source of the outbreak, but rather a facilitator of rapid transmission. The use of invasive procedures as the real risk factors of colonisation also could not be ruled out [<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Several distinct clonal clusters of <italic toggle="yes">S. marcescens</italic> belonging to four different lineages could be identified using WGS. Most of the sequenced <italic toggle="yes">S. marcescens</italic> patient isolates and all environmental isolates belonged to lineage 9 which is the major human, hospital-associated lineage. The shift of the specific clusters during the outbreak period might be linked to the control measures taken, as metabolic pathways differ between different <italic toggle="yes">S. marcescens</italic> lineages and even within lineages [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. As a result, the use of certain antiseptics could select for specific lineages or clonal clusters. Alternatively, increased pressure on medical staff due to higher bed occupancy rates, which tend to reduce hygiene compliance, or other unmeasured factors related to the total disease burden in the ward might also have contributed to the propagation of certain strains present in the ward at that time, of which some may have had a greater potential to spread within a NICU environment [<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>Polyclonal outbreaks with <italic toggle="yes">S. marcescens</italic> are not rare in NICUs, and the source of these outbreaks often remains unclear [<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>-<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. To effectively prevent a resurgence or avoid an outbreak all together, will require a better understanding of the <italic toggle="yes">S. marcescens</italic> biology, its niches and its metabolic potential.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The outbreak measures outlined in this report were effective in controlling the surge of <italic toggle="yes">S. marcescens</italic> of the protracted <italic toggle="yes">S. marcescens</italic> outbreak in our NICU.
